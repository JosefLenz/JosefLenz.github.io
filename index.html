          <p>
              I am a Fifth year student at RIT. I am working toward a B.S. in Software Engineering  <br />
              as well as minor in Philosophy with a planned graduation in 2020.<br />
              <br />
              I am currently seeking a full time development postion for after graduation in 2020<br />
              I have completed 2 co-op terms already at Alpine Software and am looking to broaden my<br />
              experience in industry before graduation. Through my coursework and job experience <br />
              I have gained the skills for full stack development and have a strong specialty in working<br />
              with enterprise level system and the domain layer of appliations<br />
              <br />
              Raised in the small town of Deep River CT. I learned how to be a contribuiting member of<br />
              my community, activly participating and volunteering with my local Boy Scout troop and<br />
              eventually I acheived the rank of Eagle Scout. Outside of my software development<br />
              experience ive worked on a broad range of teams from customer service to construction<br />
              and feel comfortable integrating myself into most any setting. From my time at Alpine<br />
              I gained experience working directly with customers to elicit requierments to perform<br />
              individual customizations to systems.<br />
              <br />
              In my free time I can often be found dungeon mastering games of D&D for my friends,<br />
              painting miniature figures, shooting pool at the bar, or wrapped up in a good book. <br />
